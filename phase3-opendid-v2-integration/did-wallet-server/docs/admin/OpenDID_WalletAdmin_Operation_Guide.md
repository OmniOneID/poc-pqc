Once Wallet is registered, it is displayed in the system as active status (`ACTIVATE`), and after registration, you can view registered information or make changes within a limited scope.

### ▸ Wallet Service Management

> **Note**  
> Currently, only Quick Register method for simple registration is supported. The formal registration procedure is scheduled to be updated in June 2025.
